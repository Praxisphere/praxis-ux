## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/praxisphere/praxisphere/issues)
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/praxisphere/praxisphere/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue with a clear title and detailed description of the suggested enhancement.
- Provide any relevant examples or mockups that could help explain your idea.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Praxisphere? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/praxisphere/praxisphere/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abeginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/praxisphere/praxisphere/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

## Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history.

## Pull Requests

2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
